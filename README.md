Quiz_Game
Questions and answers: The questions and answers are stored in a dictionary categorized.

This is how the code works:

1. Questions and Answers: The questions and answers are stored in a dictionary categorized under "History", "Geography", "Science", and "Literature".

2- The game's logic: The play_quiz() function goes through each category and asks each question to the playerâ€”the player types in their answer, and the program checks that the answer is correct.

3. Scoring: The program keeps track of how many correct answers the player has received and shows the result at the end.
